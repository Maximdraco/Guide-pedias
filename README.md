# Guide-pedias
(not final name, I accept suggestions)

A recopilatory of a combination of a guide and enciclopedia that I would make.

There are plenty of games, specially old and not very popular ones, where to find all the info one would like, you need to go trough multiple guides or forums, some of them only accesibe trough the wayback machine, or there simply isn't any information. I would like to make some compilation of this information in a single PDF document, with all the info I can gather, sources and images.

I'm also interested in making them in [Latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), so I can share here both the compiled PDF and the .tex files for anyone to edit or translate.

Why exactly? For a side my university made me writte documents in Latex, and I ended liking it more than working in Word or Libreoffice Write, at least when working with long documents, so I tough it would also help with practice.

As the name implies, this documents will contain both full guides and other information about the game, but nothing external like the history of development, and because I'm a [Retroachievements](https://retroachievements.org) user, I would also add information related to the achievements for the game in that website, if there are.

I will accept suggestions in how to format different elements of the documents, what information to add, and while I will make my own images if there are no official ones to use, maybe I could include fanart or assets made by others (with permission from the creators, with credits, links and a mention of them being non oficial) that could help to explain things from the games, you could even make your own if you want for me to use, I will credit them, but I can't pay for them, and finally this documents will be updated if there is new information found, or it needs corrections.

I don't think I will accept suggestions for games, I already have some I'm interested in, but anyone is allowed to use my code and make their own guides if they want.

And finally, I would apreaciate if you report to me any problem, if is some mistake in the information, like the source I used being wrong, some proof or way to facilitate me to reach that point in the game to verify it would be apreciated, but the report will be enough.

You can contact me sending me an email to maximdrac@gmail.com, sending a DM to my [Retroachievements account](https://retroachievements.org/user/Maximdraco), or trough the issue section of the repo.

I will also upload here other guides that I would make for games.
