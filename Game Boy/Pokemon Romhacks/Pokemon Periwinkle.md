Not sure if I will ever make a full guide for this romhack, but when it was allowed in Retroachievements I made this to help anyone to complete the pokedex, so for this information to not be lost, I will save here the exact same guide I made with no changes, but I guess I will syill update it if there is some mistake in the information.

=======================================

This is a guide focused in the Pokedex, in case of any error or extra information I missed, please send me a DM on Retroachievements: [Maximdraco](https://retroachievements.org/user/Maximdraco)

Some useful information about this game: the Battle Tent is in Celadon City, and the trade evolution pokemons can evolve by level up, they should evolve at level 32-36.

Different pokemons share the same location as in Pokemon Yellow.
